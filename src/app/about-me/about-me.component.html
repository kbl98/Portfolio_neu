    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello, I am a Frontend-Developer and Dentist based in Gr√∂benzell near
      Munich. After my Abitur I studied at the University LMU in Munich
      (Graduation in 2004). My favour for computers, coding and logical
      processes inspired me to join the Developer Akademie in Munich and become
      a Frontend-Developer.
